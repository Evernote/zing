## ⚠️ Important Notice: Seeking New Maintainer

The team behind Serge and Zing has made the decision to move on from the project. We are truly grateful to the community for their support and contributions over the years.\
**If you are passionate about Serge and have the required expertise, we invite you to consider becoming its new maintainer.** This is an opportunity to continue its legacy and ensure that Serge remains a useful tool for its users.

Please express your interest by creating an issue in the [Evernote/serge](https://github.com/Evernote/serge) repository with the title "Interested in Maintaining Serge" and provide a brief overview of your experience and why you're interested in taking over. We will review the submissions and, if a suitable candidate is identified, will facilitate a smooth transition. **The call for a new maintainer will remain open until June 30, 2024.**

**In the event that no new maintainer steps forward by the specified date, we will be decommissioning Serge, Zing, and all their assets and resources, including this repository.**

We hope Serge finds a new home, but regardless of the outcome, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has been a part of this journey.\
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Zing is an online translation server software. We [use it at
Evernote](https://translate.evernote.com/) as a translation UI on top of
[Serge](https://serge.io) — our continuous localization backend. Zing
originates from the [Pootle](http://pootle.translatehouse.org/) project and
still shares much of the DNA with it, but stays aligned with our [goals and
vision](https://github.com/evernote/zing/blob/master/GOALS.md).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Zing adheres to [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4), and as such backward incompatible
changes can be expected anytime before reaching v1.0.


Installation
------------

We are [currently working](https://github.com/evernote/zing/issues/25) to
provide an out-of-the-box installation method. In the mean-time, one can
experiment to run Zing from source, although we are not committed to support
it.


Copying
-------

Zing is released under the General Public License, version 3 or later. See the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/evernote/zing/blob/master/LICENSE) file for
